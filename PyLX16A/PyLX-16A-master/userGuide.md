## Introduction
PyLX-16A is a Python library designed to control one or more of LewanSoul's LX-16A servos. This document will walk you through the different steps of using the library to control one or more servos.

The library has the following structure:
* There is a central `LX16A` class
* Each real-life servo has a corresponding instance of the `LX16A` class in the program
* The virtual servos have member functions that control the physical servos
* When there is an error relating to a servo or servos, a `ServoError` exception is thrown

## Setup

To set up a system, such as a robot with multiple servos:
1. Install the hardware, including the servos, a power supply, a servo controller board, and cables
2. Create a folder containing lx16a.py, and your main program (such as the provided sample, helloWorld.py)
3. Run the program (if you are running the sample program, the servos will oscillate in a sine wave out of phase with each other)

### Hardware Installation

To set up the hardware for the servos:
1. Connect your compouter and the controller board with the provided USB cable
2. Connect a power source to the screw terminals on the controller board
3. Connect a servo to the controller board, it doesn't matter which socket you choose
4. (Optional) The servos can be daisy-chained, meaning you can connect servos to each other in sequence

At this point, I would recommend downloading LewanSoul's Bus Servo Terminal software, which allows you to manually control individual servos. It can be found under the PC Software tab on the Downloads section of [their website](https://lewansoul.com/).

### Software Installation

To add PyLX-16A to your project, make sure you install pySerial (`pip install pyserial`), and then place `lx16a.py` into your project directory, or clone this GitHub repository.

Before controlling the servos, there is a bit of setup that must first be done (inside the program).

#### Controller Board Initialization

NOTE: I only have experience with Windows and Raspbian. If you have more info, please contact me.

The OS interfaces wither the controller board through a serial port, but which one? To find this port, I have two methods:
* Windows - Try the ports `COM1`, `COM2`, `COM3`, etc. until it works.
* Raspbian - Try each port in `/dev/`. I used `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

Once you find this port, initialize the `LX16A` class with it. At the beginning of your code, put something like `LX16A.initialize('COM3')`, or `LX16A.initialize('/dev/ttyUSB0')`.

#### Servo Initialization

Each physical servo has an ID associated with it, stored inside the servo. This ID is in the range of 0-253 (inclusive), and is set either programmatically or using LewanSoul's software.

When a servo object is created in the program, its constructor requires an ID. When a method on a virtual servo is called, this has real world effects on the physical servo with the same ID. Essentially, if you create a servo object with ID 3, and tell that object to rotate by 90 degrees, then the real world servo with ID 3 will also rotate 90 degrees.

If two servo objects are created, and they both have the same ID, then they are both referring to the same physical servo. Remember that servo objects have member variables, so if you have two servo objects with the same ID, and call a method with one of them, then their variables will differ.
