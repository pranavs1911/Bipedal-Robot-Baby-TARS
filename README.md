# Bipedal-Robot-Baby-TARS
Python files containing the simulation and the microcontroller code for the bipedal robot. 
## Simulation
Simulation was performed on Pybullet. A simple proportional controller along with the forward kinematics model of the robot was
utilized for the simulation. 

## Programming
Raspberry Pi was utilized as the microcontroller for the bipedal robot. A proportional controller along with Lewansoul LX16A library 
was utilized to program the robot for simple joint movement. 

## Prototype
An image of the prototype and a simulation showing the robot trying to balance itself and taking very small steps.
